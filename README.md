# React Basics

This is a companion repo to my React Basics presentation which can be seen [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xwwZ18WHw5oINXmU6PpcpbpBiXRVN2CiFw2VHdlnp94/edit#slide=id.p). This project is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To get started, ensure you have installed node and in the project root run `npm i`. Once packages are installed you can run the app locally by running `npm start`.

There are sequential branches in this repo that demonstrate various steps from the presentation. Once you have started running the app locally, you can freely switch between branches and the changes will automatically appear in your browser.
