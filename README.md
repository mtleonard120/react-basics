# React Basics

This is a companion repo to my React Basics presentation which can be seen [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xwwZ18WHw5oINXmU6PpcpbpBiXRVN2CiFw2VHdlnp94/edit#slide=id.g80e66206f5_0_245). This project is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

There are sequential branches in this repo that demonstrate various steps from the presentation. See the `notes` directory for notes corresponding to each branch.

## Getting Started

To get the app up and running, ensure you have installed [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and in a terminal in the root directory run `npm i`. This step installs dependency packages for the app. Once complete, you can start the app from the root directory by running `npm start`.
