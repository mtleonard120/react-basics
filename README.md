# React Basics

This is a companion repo to my React Basics presentation which can be seen [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xwwZ18WHw5oINXmU6PpcpbpBiXRVN2CiFw2VHdlnp94/edit#slide=id.p). This project is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

There are sequential branches in this repo that demonstrate various steps from the presentation.
